# Overview
Stock Market Sentiment Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze real-time financial news sentiment for any stock ticker. Using NLP-based sentiment analysis, real-time stock price data, and semantic analysis of news headlines, this API provides insights into the market sentiment surrounding a stock.

By integrating Hugging Face NLP models, NewsAPI, and Yahoo Finance, this project helps traders, investors, and analysts make data-driven decisions.

# Features

- Confidence scores are provided for each sentiment classification.

### Live Stock Price Retrieval

# Challenges and Solutions
### Live Financial News Scraping
Issue: Yahoo Finance changes its webpage structure frequently, causing scraping failures.
Solution: Replaced it with NewsAPI, which provides reliable, structured news data.

### Sentiment Accuracy
Issue: Generic sentiment models sometimes misclassify financial sentiment.
Solution: Can be improved by fine-tuning a sentiment model for financial news.

### Correlating Stock Prices with Sentiment
Issue: Stock price changes depend on multiple factors beyond sentiment.
Solution: Future enhancements could include trend analysis over time.
